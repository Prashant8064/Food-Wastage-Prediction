📊 Food Wastage Prediction and Redistribution








🔹 Overview

Every year, tons of food goes to waste while millions go hungry.
This project leverages Machine Learning to:

🔮 Predict food wastage patterns

♻️ Suggest redistribution strategies

⚡ Optimize the use of available resources

🎯 Goal → Reduce wastage, fight hunger, and build a sustainable system.

🔹 Key Features

✅ Predicts wastage percentage from dataset
✅ Highlights high-risk categories (e.g., grains, vegetables)
✅ Suggests redistribution for NGOs/Food Banks
✅ Visualizes insights with charts 📊

🔹 Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Dataset

📁 food_wastage_data.csv

Records of food quantity, wastage %, and redistribution feasibility

Cleaned and prepared for ML model training

🔹 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data preprocessing
2️⃣ Feature engineering
3️⃣ ML model training (Random Forest Regressor)
4️⃣ Evaluation using R² Score & MSE
5️⃣ Visualization of results

🔹 Results & Insights

📈 Predictions highlight:

Categories with maximum wastage

Redistribution feasibility per category

🔹 Future Scope

🚀 Expand into a web application with:

Live data integration from restaurants & canteens

Dashboards for NGOs & Food Banks

Alerts for surplus food availability
