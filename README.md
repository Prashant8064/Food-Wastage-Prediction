📊 Food Wastage Prediction and Redistribution








🔹 Overview

Every year, tons of food goes to waste while millions go hungry.
This project leverages Machine Learning to:

Predict food wastage patterns

Suggest redistribution strategies

Optimize the use of available resources

⚡ Goal → Reduce wastage, fight hunger, and build a sustainable system.

🔹 Key Features

✅ Predicts wastage percentage from dataset

✅ Highlights high-risk categories (e.g., grains, vegetables)

✅ Suggests redistribution for NGOs/Food Banks

✅ Visualizes insights with charts 📊

🔹 Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Dataset

📁 food_wastage_data.csv

Records of food quantity, wastage %, and redistribution feasibility

Cleaned and prepared for ML model training

🔹 Project Workflow

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

ML model training (Random Forest Regressor)

Evaluation using R² Score & MSE

Visualization of results

🔹 Results & Insights

📈 Model predictions highlight:

Categories with maximum wastage

Redistribution feasibility per category

Example Visualization 👇

🔹 Future Scope

🚀 Expand this project into a web application:

Live data integration from restaurants & canteens

Dashboard for NGOs & Food Banks

Alerts for surplus food availability
